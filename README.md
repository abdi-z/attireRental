# In Progress

## Abstract

Not everyone has the privilege to buy clothes that would be used only once for an occasion. Example of such can include buying sherwani that will be used only once or twice and will be a huge waste of money as such items start with cost of around rupees 45,000. Poshak.pk will solve the problem by allowing users to rent out these expensive clothing items for a fraction of their price. This will also allow users to make some easy money by renting out their clothes that are eating dust in their closets.
